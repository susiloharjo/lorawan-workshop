RNPassthru is a test sketch that allows you to directly access either the
RN2483 LoRaWAN module or the RN4871 Bluetooth module.

From the top of the code, either comment out or leave uncommented the #define

// For RN4871 have this define uncommented
// For RN2483 comment this line.
#define USE_BLE

For further information on the commands to use, please see the user guides
for each module.
